# Задачи


#### Задача 1
Design a data structure that supports insert, delete, search and getRandom in constant time

Design a data structure that supports following operations in Θ(1) time.


insert(x): Inserts an item x to the data structure if not already present.

remove(x): Removes an item x from the data structure if present.

search(x): Searches an item x in the data structure.

getRandom(): Returns a random element from current set of elements

#### Задача 2

Print All Distinct Elements of a given integer array

1) A Simple Solution is to use two nested loops.

2) Use Sorting 

3) Use Hashing to solve this in O(n) time on average  // unordered_set<int> s; 


#### Задача 3

Non-Repeating Element

Find the first non-repeating element in a given array of integers.


1)A Simple Solution is to use two loops.

2)An Efficient Solution is to use hashing. //   unordered_map<int, int> mp;


#### Задача 4

Group Shifted String

Given an array of strings (all lowercase letters), the task is to group them in such a way that all strings in a group are shifted versions of each other. Two string S and T are called shifted if,


S.length = T.length 

and

S[i] = T[i] + K for 

1 <= i <= S.length  for a constant integer K

For example strings {acd, dfg, wyz, yab, mop} are shifted versions of each other.

Input  : str[] = {"acd", "dfg", "wyz", "yab", "mop","bdfh", "a", "x", "moqs"};


Output : a x

         acd dfg wyz yab mop

         bdfh moqs

All shifted strings are grouped together.
